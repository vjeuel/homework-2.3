# **Homework-2**

This is my [portfolio website](https://vjeuel.github.io/homework-2.3), which is divided in 3 main pages:

## **About**
Just a quick Hello, where I tell where and what I am studying, hobbies and a bit about myself.

<br>

## **Portfolio**
A few projects and past class assignments that I have worked and am working on at the moment.

<br>

## **Contact**
Invitation to creativity and where to connect with me.

Decided to use a <span style="color: #CEA11C">darker yellow</span>, <span style="color: #fd0">yellow</span>, <span style="color: #000">black</span> and <span style="color: white">white</span> as the colors of the website.

All pages used Boostrap and some Media Query for size adjustments, also used semantics to help with accessibility.
