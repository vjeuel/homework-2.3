# **Homework-2.3**

This is my [portfolio website](https://vjeuel.github.io/homework-2.3), which is divided in 3 main pages:

## **About**
Just a quick Hello, where I tell where and what I am studying, hobbies and a bit about myself.


<br>

## **Portfolio**
A few projects and past class assignments that I have worked and am working on at the moment.

<br>

## **Contact**
Invitation to creativity and where to connect with me.

<br>
<br>

### **Additional Information**
All pages used Boostrap and some Media Query for size adjustments, also used semantics to help with accessibility.
